# LinkedListInterviewQuestions
In this repository, I try to accumulate all the frequently asked coding interview questions related to LinkedList.
1. RemoveDuplicates: Write a code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. [CTCI- 2.1]
2. KthToLast: Write an algorithm to find the kth to last element of singly linked list. [CTCI- 2.2]
3. DeleteMiddle: Delete a given node from a linked list which is not the first or last node. You are not given access to the head node of the linked list. [CTCI- 2.3]
4. Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. [CTCI- 2.4]
5. Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome. [CTCI- 2.6]
6. Intersection: Given two singly linked list, return the intersecting node of two list. [CTCI- 2.7; LeetCode- 180]
7. LoopDetection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop. [CTCI- 2.8]
