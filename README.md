# LinkedListInterviewQuestions
In this repository, I try to accumulate all the frequently asked coding interview questions related to LinkedList.
1. RemoveDuplicates: Write a code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. [CTCI- 2.1]
2. KthToLast: Write an algorithm to find the kth to last element of singly linked list. [CTCI- 2.2]
3. DeleteMiddle: Delete a given node from a linked list which is not the first or last node. You are not given access to the head node of the linked list. [CTCI- 2.3]
