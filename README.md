# LinkedListInterviewQuestions
In this repository, I try to accumulate all the frequently asked coding interview questions related to LinkedList.
1. RemoveDuplicates: Write a code to remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list. [CTCI- 2.1]
2. RemoveDuplicates2: Write a code to remove duplicates from a sorted linked list. [LeetCode- 83]
3. KthToLast: Write an algorithm to find the kth to last element of singly linked list. [CTCI- 2.2]
4. DeleteMiddle: Delete a given node from a linked list which is not the first or last node. You are not given access to the head node of the linked list. [CTCI- 2.3]
5. Partition: Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. [CTCI- 2.4]
6. Palindrome: Implement a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome. [CTCI- 2.6]
7. Intersection: Given two singly linked list, return the intersecting node of two list. [CTCI- 2.7; LeetCode- 180]
8. LoopDetection: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm that returns the node at the beginning of the loop. [CTCI- 2.8]
9. ReverseList: Reverse a Linked List [LeetCode- 206]
10. DeleteNode: Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node. [LeetCode- 237]
11. MiddleNode: Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node, return a middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node. [LeetCode- 876]
12. AddTwoNumbers: Given two nonempty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list. The digits are stored in reverse order. [LeetCode- 2]
13. AddTwoNumbers2: Given two nonempty linked lists representing two non-negative integers, add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list. The digits are stored in original order. [LeetCode- 445]
